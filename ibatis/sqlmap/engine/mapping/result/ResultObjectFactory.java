/**
 * iBATIS uses an implementation of this interface to create

 * your implementation class as the type for the "resultObjectFactory"
 * element in the SqlMapConfig.  Any implementation of this interface
 * must have a public no argument constructor.
 * 
 * Note that iBATIS makes use of this interface through the
 * ResultObjectFactoryUtil class.

  /**
   * Returns a new instance of the requested class.
   * iBATIS will call this method in these circumstances:
   * 
   * <ul>
   *   <li>When processing a result set - to create new instances of result objects</li>
   *   <li>When processing the output parameters of a stored procedure - to create
   *       instances of OUTPUT parameters
   *   </li>
   *   <li>When processing a nested select - to create instances of parameter
   *       objects on the nested select
   *   </li>
   *   <li>When processing result maps with nested result maps.  iBATIS will
   *     ask the factory to create an instance of the nested object.  If the nested
   *     object is some implementation of <code>java.util.Collection</code>
   *     then iBATIS will supply default implementations of the common interfaces
   *     if the factory chooses not to create the object.  If the
   *     embedded object is a <code>java.util.List</code> or 
   *     <code>java.util.Collection</code> the default behavior is to
   *     create an <code>java.util.ArrayList</code>.  If the embedded object is a
   *     <code>java.util.Set</code> the default behavior
   *     is to create a <code>java.util.HashSet</code>.</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * If you return <code>null</code> from this method, iBATIS will attempt
   * to create in instance of the class with it's normal mechanism.  This means
   * that you can selectively choose which objects to create with this interface.
   * In the event that you choose not to create an object, iBATIS will translate some
   * common interfaces to their common implementations.  If the requested
   * class is List or Collection iBATIS will create an ArrayList.  If the requested
   * class is Set then iBATIS will create a HashSet.  But these rules only apply
   * if you choose not to create the object.  So you can use this factory to
   * supply custom implementations of those interfaces if you so desire.
   * 
   * @param statementId the ID of the statement that generated the call to this method
   * @param clazz the type of object to create
   * @return a new instance of the specified class.  The instance must
   *   be castable to the specified class.  If you return <code>null</code>,
   *   iBATIS will attempt to create the instance using it's normal 
   *   mechanism.
   * @throws InstantiationException if the instance cannot be created.  If you
   *   throw this Exception, iBATIS will throw a runtime exception in response and
   *   will end.
   * @throws IllegalAccessException if the constructor cannot be accessed.  If you
   *   throw this Exception, iBATIS will throw a runtime exception in response and
   *   will end.
